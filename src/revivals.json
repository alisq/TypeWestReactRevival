    "Revival Description": "<p>Zeitpunkt is an idiosyncratic revival of Lateinisch, designed for the Berthold Type Foundry by the Vienna Secession artist Peter Schnorr. Zeitpunkt is the product of 10 weeks of intensive development and skill acquisition, plus 126 years of typographic circulation and stasis, plus nearly 600 years of typographic history and lettering convention. Zeitpunkt is a collaboration between myself and mentors, colleagues, peers, archivists, and others. Zeitpunkt is an incomplete project whose imperfections emerge to guide new iterations and weekly development. Zeitpunkt is the realization of the horrifying truth about learning anything: the more you know how to do something, the more the flaws in your work present themselves to you.</p>",
    "Biography": "<p>Ali S. Qadeer is a designer, educator, and occasional writer, based in Toronto. After completing a BA in philosophy and religious studies at McGill University, he returned to school to complete an MFA at the Rhode Island School of Design. His work focuses on algorithmic form-making, interaction design, the intersection of design labour and political economy, as well as digital surveillance. After returning to Canada in 2014, Ali joined the faculty of OCADU where he is an Associate Professor in the Graphic Design program. In his teaching practice, Ali champions a critical approach that always refracts through a practice of formalism and material production.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://iamasq.works\"><strong>iamasq.works</strong></a></p>",

    "Source Info": "<p>Zeitpunkt is based on Lateinisch, a typeface designed by Peter Schnorr in 1899 for the Berthold Type Foundry. Schorr, an illustrator and lettering artist , emphasized fluid, organic forms in his work. Before falling out of use, Lateinisch was used throughout Germany in the early 20th century and was particularly present in books and pamphlets printed by left wing presses out of Berlin. Though it traces its source in the Vienna Secession movement, Lateinisch seemed to have widespread popularity in Germany during the moment of transition away from Frakturs. </p><p></p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>This project began with a robust research process beginning at Massey College's Robertson Davies Library at the University of Toronto.  It lead into the recesses of online archives across multiple continents. And ultimately landed in the collections of the Letterform Archive. After finding a set of artifacts with common typographic features, I was able to determine the source typeface and track down specimens. I  attempted to faithfully follow the source material, but began to stray from my sources to simplify forms and build more structural consistency in an attempt to translate its slightly ornamental character to a text face. </p>",

    "Source Info": "<p>Found in the pages of Barnhart Bros &amp; Spindler's 1907 type specimen book, Paragon is a typeface seemingly inspired by themes of travel and mysticism. In proofing texts, vocabulary associated with travels to the East such as “From India to Egypt”, “Trip Around the World” are used, intending an Oriental context. The typeface seems to resemble a typewriter typeface, emulating the feeling of a traveler documenting their travels through sent telegrams to a friend or relative.</p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>Paragon's awkward swashes and triangular serifs, if faithfully revived, would lean more towards a display typeface than a text typeface, hence it was imperative to replace those components with features that were more soothing to the present day reader. With that in mind, a thicker upped serif was added to the top and bottom of the stems, arms and legs to enhance legibility.</p>",

Designed with high contrast for a text typeface, Glamourie maintains a light, airy feel at any text size. The rounded forms of Glamourie are contrasted with squared, bracketed serifs lending a curious and clever juxtaposition to otherwise traditional letterforms. The name Glamourie comes from the Scottish Gaelic spelling for “glamour” or “charm”.</p>",

I was intrigued by the color of the type on the page and the interesting shapes of the letterforms like g and k. Initially, I hesitated to choose this typeface for my revival project because the images online were too low in resolution. Fortunately, after discussing the issue with my professors and teaching assistants, one of my professors, Michele, mentioned he owned the original specimen book. He generously provided me with extremely high-resolution scans, allowing me to successfully revive the typeface. Thank you, Michele!</p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>The assignment for this term was to design a type revival, a new design aiming to recreate the appearance, vibe, and/or mood of a historical source which may or may not be available in the current technology. For Glamourie, I stayed fairly true to the original typeface, making only minor tweaks—like extending the descenders and slightly increasing the overall weight of the uppercase letters. This project taught me a lot about both the detailed analysis and creative work involved in designing a revival. More importantly, the enjoyment I found in fine-tuning every detail—along with the invaluable insights I gained from working alongside inspiring professors and classmates—are experiences that will stay with me for a long time.</p>",

    "Process Info": "<p>At the start of Term 1, I initially looked at creating a revival for a Celtic typeface called Runic, which I had found in an online archive from 1874, and a more modern, serif-based typeface from the 1960s called Promotor. After reviewing both and hearing the pros and cons of each, I went back to the drawing board and stumbled upon Ehmcke-Latein, instantly knowing it was the one I wanted to work with for my revival.</p><p>I have always admired slab-serif typefaces, and Ehmcke-Latein had characteristics such as angled serif terminals and low contrast — almost monolinear — that appealed to me. It had also not been digitized, so I knew it would be unique and something that I could rename, revise, and call my own.</p>",

    "Source Info": "<p>My sources included a type specimen pamphlet, “Jenson Old-Style, Jenson Page Embellishments, Jenson Initials, Morris Initials”, the American Type Specimens Book, Bradley His Book, and the Ver Sacrum Art Journal. I chose Jenson Old Style based on its forms and quirky characteristics. I took a liking to its ostentatious serifs, severe angles, and sometimes unrefined components. The features felt hardened and brutal. Characters like the k, b, g, punctuation, and even the italics were interesting.&nbsp;</p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>Jenson Old Style is Joseph Warren Phinney’s pirated copy of Golden Type designed by William Morris. William Morris was a key figure in the Arts &amp; Crafts movement. The original inspiration is type design work of Nicholas Jenson. A relationship to Jenson is visible in its bones, but in personality, Rogue Serif takes a left turn.&nbsp;</p><p>Analysis</p><p>The font that Rogue Serif is based on has brutish serifs, steep angles, notches, and occasional flares. Toughened and gruff, these details create a beautifully edgy and wildly inconsistent texture, as if the subtle Jenson font we knew decided to rebel.</p><p>Key Decisions &amp; Evolution</p><p>In general, I leaned into the inky look in corners for the warmth it imparted. For serifs, I adjusted the shape and weight on certain letters for more consistency, and let the serifs get more angled in places. Generally, my intention was to keep Jenson Old Style's unique details, including certain notches, squarish ends, and flares. To resolve the font's chaotic texture and dancing features, I toned down severity of some features, and made shapes and strokes more harmonious across related characters. Rogue Serif started a bit tight and severe. Over the course of 10 weeks, it became more loose and warm. While still maintaining its brusque look, I opened the font up in terms of spacing and certain character widths and apertures, tamed the crazier modulations, and refined some of the clunkier details.</p>",

Drawing inspiration from Cadmus—a typeface first issued by Farmer, Little &amp; Co. prior to 1889—Cadmea retains the elegance of its origins while embracing current design standards. Its tall x-height, generous counters, and refined curves lend a timeless quality, ensuring clarity and comfort in long-form reading. Stylistic alternates nod to the original specimen, enhancing versatility and allowing designers to evoke a more classical tone when desired. The current character set includes 321 glyphs and supports over 230 languages, with continued expansion underway.</p>",

    "Source Info": "<p>I owe the origins of this project to a Baltimore gem: The Book Thing. More than just a bookshop or library, it’s a beloved local institution—a treasure trove for the curious and the devoted, where the unexpected always awaits. The best part? Everything is free. It’s where unwanted books find a new life, no strings attached, and an invaluable goldmine for anyone researching historical text typefaces.</p><p>There, I found a 1907 edition of <em>The Seven Seas</em> by Rudyard Kipling—a striking volume with a gold-leafed cover, illustrated borders, and typography that felt airy and refined. The type was difficult to identify, but with a timely tip from Stephen Coles, I traced its origins to A.D. Farmer &amp; Son Type Foundry. Cadmus Old Style was created sometime before 1889 and is rooted in the Elzevir tradition of 17th-century Dutch printing. Its name inspired the title of this revival. </p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>The process began with a structural study of the typeface—its proportions, stem weight, contrast, and the subtle quirks that gave it personality. Inconsistencies in the source's print quality meant ample time spent exploring the construction of the serifs to find the right rhythm. Some of the most expressive forms—like the dramatic P, the angled M, and the sweeping tail on the Q—stood out immediately. To maintain their character while offering flexibility, I created a stylistic set that provides designers with the option of a more classic look. Digitization was an iterative process made possible with thoughtful feedback each week. During this time, I compared serif styles, refined letterforms for consistency, and carefully constructed the diacritics. I also added ligatures and old-style numerals, both of which were key elements in my original text. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://michelleghiotti.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01_TW_S1_MichelleGhiotti_Cadmea_ProcessBook_Mockup.pdf\">Read more about the project</a></p>",

    "Revival Description": "<p>Cheltender is a revival of the classic Cheltenham typeface, reimagined with a \"touch of tenderness\". The central concept was to infuse softness and a gentler feel into Cheltenham's inherently somewhat awkward but elegant structure, without sacrificing its unique character. This was achieved through subtle refinements, notably by adding a slight concave detail to the serifs, which elegantly softened the traditionally rigid stems and was pivotal in realizing the envisioned tender quality. The project aimed to explore how these nuanced changes could make the typeface less rigid and more approachable<br><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://bit.ly/cheltender\"><strong>bit.ly/cheltender</strong></a></p>",

After graduating from a Design Studies program, he discovered his passion for crafting typefaces that defy conventions—melding avant-garde concepts with daring visual execution. His typography journey began with a mission to elevate Vietnamese language support in fonts, but his practice has since evolved to investigate quirky letterforms, hybrid typographic systems, and the intersection of cultural identity and design experimentation.<br><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://linktr.ee/mikeyokei\"><strong>https://linktr.ee/mikeyokei</strong></a></p>",

    "Revival Description": "<p>Typography is a garment for text. Garment is a loose revival of William Morris' Golden Type. When William Morris founded the Kelmscott Press, he envisioned books set in bespoke typefaces that would help convey his idealistic vision. The Golden Type was his first attempt at designing a Roman style suitable for text. Cut by Edward Philip Prince, it was inspired by Nicholas Jenson's work from the fourteenth century and some authors consider it the first ever type revival project. Designing Garment felt like translating a text that has already been translated before – changes become inevitable. In taking their own liberties with this Type West revival project, Flora aimed to follow Morris’s belief that revivals are not merely technical updates of past designs – they should be approached with creativity and passion.</p>",

    "Source Info": "<p>The idea of reviving Golden came to me while I was browsing the Letterform Archive Online Collection and stumbled upon “The Nature of Gothic”, a chapter from the second volume of the “Stones of Venice” trilogy by John Ruskin (1819–1900). The book was fully composed in Golden and printed by the Kelmscott Press in 1892.</p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>There are different ways of approaching a revival project, but for this term, we were encouraged by the teachers to follow a list of exercises that helped us develop a deep understanding of our historical models before we started making our own decisions based on both knowledge and intuition. The exercises were the following: (A) Collecting glyphs from a printed source; (B) Analysing the glyphs in context;&nbsp;(C) Tracing the outlines of the original in Glyphs. (D) Refining the shapes. From the many inconsistencies found in Golden, some were embraced and others discarded: the ones that looked cool were kept; others, which seemed like mistakes to the contemporary eye, were removed. When designing Garment, I was more focused on what Morris wanted to achieve with Golden than on the final results he produced. There’s also the fact that Golden can be considered a revival itself. The typeface is visibly not the same as its model, so why should Garment – designed over one hundred years later – be the same as Golden? Again, my main concern was to honor Morris’ approach without necessarily mimicking his output.</p>",

It also balances the original proportions with contemporary aesthetics, allowing the face to live both in the past and the present.</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">The current face honors the original source and its forebears while providing a moderately quirky take on the Scotch Roman sub-family of typefaces.

    "Biography": "<p style=\"text-align: left\">Jesse M. Kahn is both a fine artist and a graphic designer. He has been a professor of both for the last 20 years. In that time, he has also maintained a private design practice and exhibited his fine art across the US. Under the moniker Two Face Type, Jesse designs display faces. He has also designed typefaces specifically for his&nbsp; art making practice.</p><p>Originally trained as a painter and printmaker, Jesse employs photography, graphic design, traditional handicrafts, and sculptural techniques to explore Gay male sexuality and concerns over the division between public &amp; private space, freedom of expression, and between personal &amp; national security. His most recent work has begun to mine the archives of Gay and Queer art made in the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p>Most recently Jesse was an Associate Professor and Interim Dean of Academic Services and Programs at Montserrat College of Art. His research and teaching interests include Gay identity in the history of art, Typography, and Book Arts. He has also taught design &amp; digital photography to urban youth, and guest lectured on art history and Queer craft.</p><p>Born and raised in the American South, Jesse has lived in Boston, MA with his husband for the past 25 years.

    "Source Info": "<p>I chose “Leaves of Grass”, variously because of its importance in American poetry history, its place in Queer American culture, the truly terrible printing of the first edition (leaving lots of peculiarities to inform the revival), and because, in our book group of two, my friend Andrew Egan and I were reading Arnie Kantrowitz’ posthumously published homage to Whitman, “Song of Myself”.</p><p>The first edition of \"Leaves of Grass\" was was anonymously self-published by Whitman in 1855. It was printed at the Rome print shop in Brooklyn, NY. Rome was a business forms printer and this was an after hours job not typical of the press. This might help explain the scale and proportions of the book (a quarto), as well as the haphazard printing of the pages, with some being both over and under inked on the same page. The type might also have been old and worn, as there are many scratches and pits in the printing, as well as loads of variation in the letterforms across pages.</p>",
    "Process Info": "<p style=\"text-align: left\">During the analysis period I began to identify what I thought might bring a Queer sensibility to the type. I knew that the source material itself lent some Queerness, but I also wanted some visual indications in how I drew the letterforms. The poor printing suggested some opportunities, but in the long run, I felt that drawing from that would create too much variation and interruption for the reader. I also noticed how the printed characters looked like they came from a very worn set of metal type; which gave variety to the letters across each character.</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">My process included periods of character refinement, careful attention to both the source and to related faces like Bruce's Pica No. 2, Didot, and Baskerville.</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">I then extended the character set to include diacritics and mathematical formula glyphs. In that process I received expert input from Christian Thalmann and Dr. Ian Sue Wing.</p>",

Named after the Latin word for \"ancestor,\" Atavus bridges the gap between historical typography and contemporary design.

    "Source Info": "<p>Antique No. 525 is a bracketed slab serif originally published by American Type Founders (ATF), appearing in their 1923 specimen book. Designed for clarity and durability in industrial printing environments, it features a tall x-height, low contrast, and tight vertical proportions. Short ascenders and descenders allowed for economical use of space—ideal for dense settings like newspapers.</p><p>What sets this face apart is its warmth: subtly curved serifs and open apertures soften the rigidity typical of slab serifs, lending Antique No. 525 an unusual friendliness and approachability. These nuanced details made it a compelling candidate for revival—not just for its functionality, but for its distinctive voice within the typographic history. </p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>The development of Atavus began with a deep study of Antique No. 525 and the broader “Antique” lineage of slab serifs, including early 19th-century designs by Vincent Figgins. From there, the process involved careful analysis of printed specimens, carefully digitizing the letterforms, and iterating across multiple versions—each one refining proportions, weight distribution, and spacing.</p><p>Key adaptations included optimizing the rhythm for onscreen legibility, rebalancing spacing for contemporary text settings, and harmonizing curve tensions while preserving the original's idiosyncrasies. The final version of Atavus retains the personality of its ancestor, now optimized for clarity, usability, and modern design contexts.</p>",

    "Revival Description": "<p><strong>Agustina Serif</strong> is a revival text typeface based on the letterforms found in the book <em>Art of the Mexican Language</em>, printed in 1673 in Mexico City by the Novohispanic printer Francisco Rodríguez Lupercio and written by the Franciscan chronicler Agustín de Vetancurt, from whom it takes its name. This book is one of the most important works of the colonial period dedicated to the study of Nahuatl—the language of the Mexica (also known as the Aztecs). In addition to being a historian, Vetancurt showed a deep interest in Indigenous languages, and his work reflects both a missionary perspective and a genuine respect for the structure and complexity of Nahuatl.</p><p>The goal of this revival is to bring back the colonial and Baroque essence of those letterforms in a typeface that supports Nahuatl, Spanish, and other Indigenous languages of the Americas.</p>",

    "Source Info": "<p>The book <em>Art of the Mexican Language</em> was selected based on the national and emotional bond I felt with it. It is preserved in the reserved archives of the Mexican National Library and serves as a grammar manual for learning and understanding Náhuatl.</p><p>I wanted to be able to consult the original reference in person, rather than relying solely on a scan from a foreign library. I deeply value this part of the revival journey, as it led me to visit the National Library for the first time and request permission to see the book. The experience of holding a 400-year-old book in my hands was profoundly moving. It made me realize that inspiration can be found anywhere, and for me, it was especially meaningful that my source comes from my own context and culture—something that became a powerful motivation for this project.</p><p>I also chose this book because I was drawn to the aesthetics of the letters—not just the Roman type, but the other characters throughout the text. It offers a wealth of typographic references, including italics, swashes, ornaments, and even engravings. The italics, in particular, inspired me with their uppercase swashes and distinctive look, along with other features that give them a strong Baroque and colonial feel.</p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>Since the beginning of the process, I received advice from both Sahar and Michele, who warned me it would be a challenge due to the age of the book. The original source has aged, textured paper, and the letters show significant ink spread. These features made the letterforms blurry and irregular, making it difficult to distinguish details such as contrast, serif shapes, terminals, and other finer elements.</p><p>This required a careful selection of the best possible samples for each letter, including diacritics, ligatures, figures, and more—along with a great deal of interpretative work and design decisions to complete the digitization.</p><p>Rather than focusing solely on fidelity to the original source, the design process centered more on my own interpretation of the letterforms. Through detailed analysis of their structure and features, I aimed to maintain consistency across characters while adding a personal touch to the typeface—drawing inspiration from the book’s style, including its ornaments and engraved illustrations.</p>",

    "Revival Description": "<p>Griffonso is a modern version of a Renaissance typeface by Francesco Griffo. It has medium contrast and a light feel, with square, open capital letters. The serifs are gently cut, and round letters have a diagonal slant. With a balanced x-height and details like the Q’s tail and a calligraphic ampersand, it looks elegant and stays easy to read. It's great for both long texts and headlines, showing the quality of early serif designs.</p>",
    "Biography": "<p>Uliana Tsoryk is an independent graphic designer, calligrapher and letterer from Ukraine, based in Kyiv. She has an 5 years of experience in graphic design. She is also an emerging type designer — she created her first typeface in 2022 as part of her diploma project. Since then, Uliana has been continuing to develop her path in type design. She works on the development of Ukrainian Cyrillic and uses her lettering in various commercial projects.

    "Source Info": "<p>This Renaissance serif typeface was first designed by Francesco Griffo in 1499. I came across it in Art of the Printed Book 1455–1955, where it was shown as an example of early metal type. It has medium contrast and a light, open look, with square capital letters and gently cut serifs. The round letters have a diagonal slant, and the x-height is well balanced. Details like the tail of the Q and the calligraphic ampersand give it an elegant feel. It works well for both long texts and headlines, showing the quality of early serif type design.</p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>The printed example showed a wide variety of serif styles, likely due to the way ink flowed during printing. As a result, printers had multiple serif variations to choose from. Certain characters were missing from the original typeface, including J, K, U, W, Z, j, k, s, v, w, z, as well as all numerals. These were later constructed based on the logic and style of the existing letters, following a faithful and refined digitization process that established the core proportions of the typeface. To preserve the typeface’s original calligraphic spirit, special care was taken in the design of the more expressive forms. The flowing, organic tail of the Q and Y was intentionally retained and echoed in letters like R and K, maintaining a consistent rhythm and historical character throughout the set.</p>",

    "Revival Description": "<p>Hrabina is a revival of Antiqua No. 6, a serif typeface found in the Koziańscy Brothers’ specimen, published around 1929. The font was one of several likely based on typefaces from the Hermann Berthold A.G., a German type foundry.</p><p>Hrabina is a modern typeface, Didot-like in style: elegant and narrow, with quite a contrast and vertical stress. Elegant, yet full of character, it features playful elements in a few letters, like the leg on the uppercase R, soft ball terminals, and soft brackets in serifs. Hrabina is in between a faithful revival and a modern take on classic letterforms.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://domifederowicz.com\"><strong>domifederowicz.com</strong></a><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/domi.federowicz/\"><strong>instagram.com/domi.federowicz</strong></a></p>",

    "Tester Text": "Among the permanent components of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, ice is the most widespread. Glaciers alone cover an area of over 15 million square kilometers, which constitutes about 3 percent of the Earth's total surface and about 10 percent of the total land surface; after all, an entire part of the world—Antarctica—has an area equal to that of Europe and Australia combined, submerged under a single crystal wave—a single mass of ice.

    "Source Info": "<p>The source of the font is Koziański’s New Fonts collection found in the Ossolineum Library, one of Poland’s oldest archives. The specific font identified is Antiqua No 6, a narrow serif typeface. Consultations with experts brought up the idea that the font’s origins may be German and classified it as a modern Didot-style typeface. Its features include straight lines, vertical stress, high contrast, ball terminals, and bracketless serifs.</p><p>Koziańscy started printing in 1910 with the daily magazine Kuryer Codzienny, releasing it each day earlier than their competitors. This helped them grow larger, publishing not only the daily magazine but books as well. By 1927, they expanded by buying the bankrupt Samuel Orgelbrand Factory and growing from Kraków to Warsaw. That’s how they became big, and this exact specimen comes from that successful period.</p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>At the start, I aimed to capture the original source’s sharp, clean style, combining straight lines with delicate ball terminals to create rhythm and balance. This project was a deep dive into how letterforms are built—exploring contrast, how serifs relate to letter shapes, and how different parts of each letter interact to form a consistent, functional set. I studied letter groups by shape and paid close attention to details like stroke connections and visual weight distribution.</p><p>Throughout the process, feedback helped me refine the typeface, leading to subtle but important changes such as adding brackets and adjusting stem connections for better harmony. This shifted the project from a faithful revival to a more thoughtful interpretation of the original.</p><p>A key lesson was learning to critically evaluate historical sources, understanding that early type designers might have made compromises or mistakes, which can be improved with modern knowledge. By the end, I valued careful decision-making, training my eye to spot subtle details, and ensuring overall consistency. This experience has strengthened my understanding of letterforms and design, though I know there is still much to learn.</p>",

This refined serif font captures the elegance of its predecessor through cupped serifs, controlled contrast, and balanced proportions. Its distinctive rhythm emerges from the interplay of soft curves and sharp cuts, creating a tone that is both classic and fresh.</p><p>The name Rosendael draws from the Dutch word Roos—meaning “rose”—a nod to the designer’s surname, as well as a historic castle and region in the Netherlands. It grounds the typeface in a sense of cultural heritage and typographic legacy.</p>",

    "Source Info": "<p>Sjoerd Hendrik de Roos (1877–1962) was a prolific Dutch designer who played a vital role in shaping modern Dutch graphic tradition. Trained as a lithographer and educated at the Royal Academy of Arts, he developed a deep passion for type design.</p><p>His final and most celebrated typeface, De Roos Romein (and its italic, Cursief), was completed during World War II and released in 1947 to mark his 70th birthday. In 1948, it was used in a special edition of the Dutch Constitution signed by Queen Juliana during her inauguration. The typeface is known for its refined contrast, tall lowercase letters, elegant cupped serifs, and a remarkably expressive italic that harmonizes beautifully with the roman.</p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>For my first Type West assignment, I chose the De Roos typeface for a text revival project. I was drawn to its elegance and unique character, which felt like it was crafted with a broad-edge nib. Each week, I refined the design by applying the insights and techniques learned in class, from structural adjustments to spacing improvements. The most rewarding part was witnessing the rapid evolution of the typeface, supported by consistent, hands-on feedback from our instructors. Despite the challenges of maintaining quality under tight deadlines, this period was a valuable time of growth—both creatively and technically.</p>",

    "Revival Description": "<p>Rushing Monotone is a transitional revival serif designed for long-form text. It has a low-contrast design with an even weight, prioritizing legibility at small sizes and making it an ideal text-weight typeface for typesetting books. The stroke proportions of Rushing Monotone at times fall into an optically monolinear quality. The overall simple design is accented with subtle expressive moments, such as exaggerated ball terminals, swashes, and a formal, geometric approach used throughout the punctuation &amp; diacritical system.</p>",
    "Biography": "<p>Rushing Monotone was designed by Rush Jackson in 2025, during Term 1 of postgraduate studies at Type West 2025, under the direction of Sahar Afshar, Michele Patané, Annie Szafranski, and April Moralba.</p><p><br>Rush Jackson is an artist and designer based in Brooklyn, NY. <br><a target=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://rushjackson.com\">Rush Jackson Studio</a> </p>",

    "Source Info": "<p>Inspired by (Lining) Cushing Monotone No. 553, the metal type design was first produced by American Type Founders Co. circa 1897-1899. Cushing Monotone was a part of a series of typefaces that were not distinctly a family, but perhaps grouped by tone. Other fonts in this “group” include Cushing Antique, Cushing Old Style, and Cushing. </p><p>The design has been credited to Josiah Stearns Cushing, a Boston-based printer, along with the rest of the Cushing series. It is noted that Cushing most likely hired independent contractors to create the design. Rushing Monotone is heavily informed by the original design, but is not a faithful digitisation. Rushing has been drawn to prioritize legibility and a cohesive overall design system. Changes made to the design include altering the stroke contrast and weight, and establishing more cohesive width proportions throughout the design.</p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>I began my research by searching online databases for metal type printing specimens, with a personal goal of finding a low-contrast transitional serif with the right amount of eccentricities. I first found lower-quality scans, and wasn’t able to find high-resolution images until a few weeks after starting, and while those helped, they still didn’t provide a fully clear idea of the full character set.</p><p>Notable differences were found across different ATF type specimen books, as the design changed from 1897–1899. Additionally, slight differences were made to Cushing Monotone across different point sizes. To solve for this, these design details were analyzed and averaged into a final skeleton. At times, monolinear stroke proportions were given additional contrast, to reduce the heaviness, especially in letters like ‘g’.</p>",

    "Revival Description": "<p>Quillibrium is a revival of Columbia by Walter H. McKay, a typeface designed to provide solutions for various printing methods in the mid-nineteenth century.</p><p>In spite of its focus on functionality, Quillibrium’s round, cupped serifs and ball terminals capture a warm, modest tone that mirrors the personality of the original designer. Ideal for small sizes, Quillibrium’s strong, even color makes it a functional workhorse for both digital and physical applications.</p><p>The name is a play on the word “Equilibrium,” a synonym for ‘balance,' referencing the original goal of the typeface - “to achieve a harmonious combination of technology and beauty.” The use of “Quill” is a nod to Walter and his affinity for calligraphy.</p>",
    "Biography": "<p>Dallas is a Cincinnati born and current Seattle-based graphic designer focusing on crafting visual identities with an emphasis on typography.</p><p>During his college days in Cincinnati, Dallas’ work was nationally recognized by the American Advertising Federation at the 2017 National ADDY Award Gala in New Orleans, LA. He was one of two community college students to receive the honor that year. Since then, Dallas has worked for agencies in Cincinnati, Atlanta and Seattle with work ranging from packaging to advertising to wayfinding signage. He served as a mentor for AIGA Atlanta, helping rising designers achieve their goal of landing an agency job. He is also a frequent feature in their annual poster show.</p><p>When he’s not at his desk working, you can find Dallas watching soccer, riding his bike, or paddle boarding on Lake Union, all while daydreaming about the work he has to do once he returns to his desk.<br><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"http://dallasford.me\"><strong>dallasford.me</strong></a><br><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dallasforrd/\"><strong>https://www.instagram.com/dallasforrd/</strong></a></p>",

    "Source Info": "<p>I initially discovered Columbia while sorting through type specimen books at the Letterform Archive. I was drawn to its bold weight and sense of warmth achieved through the rounded serifs.&nbsp;</p><p>Digging a little deeper, I learned that Columbia was considered a “commercial failure” due to lack of sales. My research led me to connect with Mathieu Lommen at the University of Amsterdam, he provided me with an online archive of TypeFoundry Amsterdam, which included hundreds of sketches, notes and written communications - providing me with a deep insight into the original design process and discovering some personal connections along the way. <br><br>These original sketches and communications, along with The Five Columbia Series specimen book, became the catalyst for my decision making which influenced the revival’s alternate characters and the new name - bringing the type designer and his original ideas into the limelight.</p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>Designed by Walter H. McKay for Type Foundry Amsterdam, the Columbia type family was created to fulfill a number of formulated demands to support daily printing practices in the mid-nineteenth century. These demands had to create a balance to work with the three prominent printing processes of their time - letterpress, offset and gravure.&nbsp;</p><p>To solve for letterpress, the typeface was designed with no sharp edges that could eventually wear, helping prevent break off. In offset, the image receives less ink, leading to a lack of saturation. To combat this, Columbia was designed with strong, even color throughout to maintain its strength. And lastly Columbia was designed with no thin hairlines so it wouldn’t get blurred or lost in the gravure screen.&nbsp;</p><p>My revival maintains Columbia's strong, even color, with redrawn serifs and ball terminals that maintain the warmth of the characters while opening its apertures, creating a legible face for all sizes.</p>",

    "Revival Description": "<p>Klamm is a revival of a Runic specimen from The American Type Foundry specimen catalog (1923). <br><br>When making the font, inspiration from The Castle by Franz Kafka came to mind. Runic is a type that has an orderly appearance but very exaggerated characteristics like cupped serifs, narrow rounds, and sharp endings. The Castle is a novel in which a character is invited to survey land including a castle at the top of the town's hill, however, he can't gain access no matter how many steps and hoops he goes through. The whole novel is a metaphor for bureaucracy and how such an extreme degree of order can become comical. <br><br>When looking at the original Runic source, it aims to be stately but the curved serifs and concave terminals make it feel much more absurd and playful. Like in The Castle, there's a comical absurdity to the stateliness. The final typeface name is Klamm, named after one of the unattainable characters in the novel.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br></p>",

    "Source Info": "<p>Klamm is a revival of a Runic specimen from The American Type Foundry specimen catalog (1923). Runic was an odd choice. It is both a typeface and a category of typefaces that emerged in the late 19th century. The Runic category was originated at Reed &amp; Fox c.1873 and consists of roman typefaces with sharp Latin serifs, or flared Glyphic terminals. <br><br>Because of this, there was a lot of variety in each source pulled. I centered my main inspiration on one source (the black and white scan). This source incorporated elements I used in my revival, such as a square tittle, cupped serifs, and flat, slightly concave terminals. However, I still used other sources and specimens and was specifically inspired by the concave crossbars and spurred serifs on other sources. <br><br>Runic stood out. It was imperfect and strange. It had a condensed look that almost made it look geared towards circus branding. It had long cupped serifs and strange dipped crossbars. I knew it was possibly more display feeling rather than made for text, but still, I chose it. I knew it was something I could be decisive with. It was a strange font with daring characteristics that could morph into something striking.&nbsp;</p>",
    "Process Info": "<p>The process of reviving Runic was difficult. With multiple varying sources there were multiple attributes and directions I could take the revival. When reviving a more displaying leaning type for text, certain attributes have to change to account for legibility.<br><br>In the many drafts and iterations the most variety can be seen in the weight of the typeface. The serifs got so thick at one point it changed the category of the typeface into more of a slab serif. Towards one of the later weeks of the program, a decision had to be made about if the revival should prioritize legibility or faithfullness to the source. <br><br>In the end, a balance was found in both. Serifs became the original eye catching sharp thinness in the original sources. The characters were adapted to be slightly wider, rounder, and thicker. </p>",

    "Tester Text": "In 1889, The Great Western Type Foundry was purchased by brothers Alson E., Arthur Middleton, George W., and Warren Barnhart. A few years later, Barnhart Bros. and Spindler was officially founded as a renewed type foundry in 1873 in Chicago, IL. BB&S proved themselves as a national success with notable typefaces like: Cooper Black, Cheltenham, Bookman & Mission. The key Shop Artists of BB&S were: Oswald Cooper, Sidney Gaunt, Will Ransom, and Robert Wiebking. They went on to produce over 200 European typefaces. After roughly 40 years, it was bought out by the American Type Foundry in 1911; eventually defunct in 1933. BB&S typefaces are still widely popular and in-use today. ",

The cover consists of black and blue ink on brown paper. Designed by BB&amp;S’s Shop Artist, Sidney Clyde Gaunt. Mission is the primary focus of this type specimen, occupying 17 of the 24 pages.

    "Process Info": "<p style=\"text-align: left\">The \"Shop Artist\" process was difficult, learning as I go but determined to tame the beast. I was aiming<strong> </strong>in finding a balance between readability while maintaining the triangular serifs and tiny ornate details throughout the character set. I asked myself \"How do I keep the mixture of organic and geometric shapes?\" throughout the term.</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">The text in the type specimen was in various sizes, it was difficult to narrow down an x-height, overshoots, and ascenders. Nevertheless, decisions needed to be made. I moved forward with the direction of faithful digitization even though it leaned a bit display for a text typeface. A large  decision was whether or not I was going to maintain the organic curves on the insides of the capitals like B, E, F, H, or cut it. The curves were kept since it was a part of the characteristics of the typeface.</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">Thankfully the feedback from professors, guest critics, and outside critics helped me progress as the weeks went on. I find that the back and fourth of toning down or even adding to the letterforms  was necessary to figure out what truly felt and looked right for \"Shop Artist\".</p><p style=\"text-align: left\">All in all, \"Shop Artist\" went through quite a few (needed) transformations that pushed it to the end of Term 1.</p>",
